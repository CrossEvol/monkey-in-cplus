# Syntax
In case you forgot what Monkey looks like, here is a small snippet that tries to cram as much of Monkey’s features into as few lines as possible:

```javascript
let name = "Monkey";
let age = 1;
let inspirations = ["Scheme", "Lisp", "JavaScript", "Clojure"];
let book = {
    "title": "Writing A Compiler In Go",
    "author": "Thorsten Ball",
    "prequel": "Writing An Interpreter In Go"
};

let printBookName = fn(book) {
    let title = book["title"];
    let author = book["author"];
    puts(author + " - " + title);
};

printBookName(book);
// => prints: "Thorsten Ball - Writing A Compiler In Go"

let fibonacci = fn(x) {
    if (x == 0) {
        0
    } else {
        if (x == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2);
        }
    }
};

let map = fn(arr, f) {
    let iter = fn(arr, accumulated) {
        if (len(arr) == 0) {
            accumulated
        } else {
            iter(rest(arr), push(accumulated, f(first(arr))));
        }
    };
    
    iter(arr, []);
};

let numbers = [1, 1 + 1, 4 - 1, 2 * 2, 2 + 3, 12 / 2];
map(numbers, fibonacci);
// => returns: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```
Translated into a list of features, we can say that Monkey supports:

- integers
- booleans
- strings
- arrays
- hashes
- prefix-, infix- and index operators
- conditionals
- global and local bindings
- first-class functions
- return statements
- closures
